# 🛠️ Program Management Showcase

This repository contains small, beginner-friendly projects that demonstrate how program management intersects with technical tools, stakeholder communication, and process improvement.

## 📂 Projects

1. **Project Tracker App**  
   A simple app to simulate tracking tasks, owners, and timelines.

2. **Stakeholder Communication Generator**  
   A command-line tool that outputs a sample communication plan based on input.

3. **Tech Term Translator**

## ✨ Why This Repo?

As a program manager in tech, I believe in bridging the gap between people, process, and technology. These projects show how even non-engineering roles benefit from understanding and applying simple tools and code.
