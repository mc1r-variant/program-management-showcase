## ✨ Why This Repo?

 Why This Repo?
As a program manager in tech, I believe in bridging the gap between people, process, and technology. These projects show how even non-engineering roles benefit from understanding and applying simple tools and code. 

*Side effects may include: a new found excitment for learning and discovering that coding isn't as scary as it looks!* 😄
