# 😂 Tech Term Translator

A sarcastic glossary for modern tech jargon. Translate corporate-speak, buzzwords, and Microsoft nonsense into real talk.

This project pokes fun at everyday tools (hi, Microsoft Teams 👀) and terms that PMs and devs run into constantly.

## 💡 Why It Exists

Because sometimes the best way to deal with jargon fatigue is to... make fun of it.

Also: it’s a great way to show off beginner-friendly JS skills like:

- Event listeners
- DOM updates
- Object-based lookup
- Randomized messages
