# ðŸ“‹ Project Tracker App

A simple, browser-based task tracking app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript â€” designed to showcase lightweight technical tools a program manager might prototype or spec out.

This project demonstrates task creation, visual organization, and status-based filtering â€” all on the front end.
